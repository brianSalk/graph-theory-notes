# Graph Notes
In graph theory, a graph is the simplest way to model a network.  Graphs consist of zero or more ***NOdes*** and ***Edges***.
## Vocabulary, Notation and Definitions
A graph $\mathcal{G}$ consists of $2$ sets, a set of verticies $\mathcal{V}$ and a set of edges $\mathcal{E}$.  
**Multiedge**: an edge that appears more than once in a graph.  
**Multigraph**: a graph that contains at least one multiedge.  
**Loop**: an edge that connects a node to itself.  
**Simple Graph**: a graph with no loops or multiedges.  
Given an edge $e = \\{u,v\\}$, $u$ and $v$ are the **end verticies**.  $u$ and $v$ are **incident** with $e$.  $u$ and $v$ are adjacent to eachother and therefor neighbors.  
**Valency** or **degree**: the number of times a vertex appears as an end vertex in that graph, or the number of edges connected to that vertex.  
Graphs can be displayed as adjacency lists or as diagrams.
